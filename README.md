### Building the technology of tommorrow, today
Like a writer bringing pages to life with words, I enliven electronics with code, driven to create the technology of tomorrow, today. 
 
I'm extremely interested in computer architecture, low-latency programming, signal processing, electronics, and deep learning. I've worked on many high-impact projects, driving my features from ideation to deployment with measurable results under tight deadlines. I excel in fast-paced, multidisciplinary environments, with a focus on new product development.

I'm seeking 2025 new grad opportunities, reach out if we have common interests!
