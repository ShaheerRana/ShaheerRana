### Welcome
Like a writer bringing pages to life with words, I bring electronics to life with code, driven by a firm desire to create the technology of tomorrow, today.

My story?

I'm Shaheer, an aspiring mechatronics engineer at the University of Waterloo building the future of travel. I lead our Hyperloop design team Waterloop and direct all technical aspects of the Canadian Hyperloop Conference, North America's only current Hyperloop competition.

My pen?

The ink: C/C++, Python, Kernel

The body: Altium, PSIM, SolidWorks

How it comes together: I combine two different worlds of engineering, research with practical application, as I materialize my passion for entrepreneurship in robotics, motors, controls, and more innovative fields.

My next chapter?
Making the next big thing happen. Iâ€™m seeking 4 month internships starting in September 2022 and would love to talk to anyone with shared interests!
