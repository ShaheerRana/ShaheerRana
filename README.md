### Welcome
Like a writer bringing pages to life with words, I bring electronics to life with code, driven by a firm desire to create the technology of tomorrow, today.

My story?  
I'm Shaheer, an aspiring mechatronics engineer at the University of Waterloo.

My pen?  
The ink: C, C++, Python, Bash/zsh, JavaScript, Java, Make, GNU, VHDL, Assembly, MySQL, Node.js, QT  
The chassis: Altium, PSIM, Soldering, Oscilloscopes, Signal Generators, Wiring, SolidWorks. 

How it comes together: I combine two different worlds of engineering, research with practical application, as I materialize my passion for robotics, computing, and more innovative fields. 

My next chapter?
Making the next big thing happen. Iâ€™m seeking 4 month internships starting in September 2022 or May 2023 and would love to talk to anyone with shared interests!
